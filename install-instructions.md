Thank you for enrolling in my workshop, Master the Tidyverse. 

To prepare for the workshop, please, bring a laptop to class that has the following installed:

* A recent version of R (>=3.5.0), which is available for free at cran.r-project.org
* A recent version of RStudio Desktop (>=1.1.456), available for free at www.rstudio.com/download (RStudio Desktop Open Source License)
* The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:

```
install.packages(c("babynames", "nycflights13", "mgcv", "repurrrsive", "rmarkdown", "tidyverse", "plotly", "flexdashboard"))
```

And don't forget your power cord!

If possible, also, please, sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/. The RStudio Cloud will be used as a backup if there will be anything wrong with your installation. 

I look forward to meeting you,

Petr
