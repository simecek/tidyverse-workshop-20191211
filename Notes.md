## Day 1

### 00 Intro

Intro went smoothly and was quick. 

### 01 Data Visualization

We skipped slides 83 - 114 (Coordinate systems - Grammar of Graphics) and it was a good decision. I was able to fit the block into the morning session (plus extra five minutes after lunch for Extras).

### 02 Data Transformation

Karla skipped the last few slides with $ (and I missed this functionality in RMarkdown part).

### 03 Report

Weakest point of Day 1. Most likely for multiple reasons. People were already tired (we should end at 4pm at the latest), I have never seen (or do not rememeber) Garrett presenting this. Too complicated and not enough exercises. Maybe, we should redesign this part from scratch and cut its length to 50%.

## Day 2

### 04 Joining Data

This runs smoothly, people were a bit more tired than on the first day. Database about flights was not so interesting for biologists. (This is even more true for `mpg` dataset).

### 05 Types

That was good. People were asking the right questions. I skipped slides 71 - 74 (Similar reordering functions)

### 06 Tidy

Not bad but it was becoming a bit boring and we skipped slides 67 - 97 (WHO Untidy Data - Missing values) and it was good decision.

### 07 Lists

Funny part with lists at the end. People were tired but it worked much better than RMarkdown yesterday. We did just slides 0-67 (lists & intro to purrr).

## Other(s)

### What was good

* Working in groups (making sure beginners and advanced are mixed)
* Green and red stick-up notes
* Feedback from the first day
* Working on local machines (but having cloud instances as a backup)

### Space for improvement

* Markdown part
* Working with people that see R & RStudio for the first time is challenging. Maybe some pre-course materials? Or ask for some R experience next time.
* People were tired at the end of the second day. (We need to include some fun stuff)
* People at CEITEC would love to have a statistical course (ANOVA, T-test & friends)
